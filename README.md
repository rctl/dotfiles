## Dotfiles and useful scrips
These are the dotfiles and scripts I use regulary on my mac. **Use the scripts and dotfiles in this repository at your own risk!**. This reposity is intended for my own use (new mac -> simple installation), but you can use this if you want, nothing limits you from that.

## Installation

`./install.sh`

## Features

- Git integration in prompt
- Shortcommands and scripts for git (add/push/pull/commit etc etc)
- `alias nano="vi"`
- Colored and minimal prompt
